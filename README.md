## What are Artifacts and why this project?

Artifacts are interactive web applications created by [Claude AI](https://claude.ai), and they are a great way to get started with web development.

They are typically created in a web browser at Claude's website, and then saved as a single file containing the main logic of the app.

Claude already provides both **Copy** and **Download** buttons for you to get the Artifact code, but it **does not provide** either:
* the **final files** that are needed to run the Artifact independently,
* or the **full project** needed to develop it further.

> Note that the code loaded by your web browser to run the Artifact is not the same as the code you copy or download from the web interface; the former is a transpiled, minimized and bundled version that includes all the necessary libraries (e.g., React) required to run it (i.e. the files that result from a build process); the latter is the raw code that you can copy and paste into your own project.

If you're unfamiliar with the technologies used on the project, you'll have a hard time assembling and configuring all the required libraries and tooling required to make a running standalone app.

Even if you're an experienced developer, you may just want to save time and effort and get the Artifacts running as easily and as soon as possible.

This template project, and the accompanying `npx` command, provide the **fastest** and **easiest** way to get your Artifacts up and running on your machine.

It includes all the necessary dependencies and configurations to seamlessly transition your Claude-generated Artifacts into a fully functional web application in no time.

## Use Cases

1. Run Artifacts on your local machine, on a web server or on a cloud service.
2. Use Artifacts as a starting point for a new project and then extend it with custom code.
3. Create a new web application and add some Artifacts to it.
4. Develop an Artifact Creator web application and use the `npx` command to dynamically run or download them.
5. Use the `npx` command as part of a CI/CD build pipeline.
6. Or don't use Artifacts at all and just use the project as a starting point for your custom coded web application.

## Quick Start

### If you want to just run an Artifact
1. Download the Artifact to your local machine, as a `.tsx` or `.jsx` file.
2. **Run it:** On the terminal, run `npx run-claude-artifact <path-to-file>`
3. Wait a few seconds. A browser window or tab will open and you'll see your Artifact running. When finished, press `Ctrl+C` on the terminal to stop the preview server.

If you don't have an Artifact to run yet, and just want to try out the project, run `npx run-claude-artifact` with no arguments to see a demo.

### If you want to build an Artifact
1. Download the Artifact to your local machine, as a `.tsx` or `.jsx` file.
2. **Build it:** On the terminal, run `npx run-claude-artifact build <path-to-file>`

The tool outputs an HTML file in your current directory, which contains all the code for running the application (HTML, CSS and JavaScript code).

This file can be deployed to any **static** web hosting service or cloud platform.

### If you want to view a previously built Artifact


**Built Artifacts require a web server to run correctly.** If you try opening them directly in a browser (by double-clicking the file), the run will **fail** due to browser security restrictions.

For quick local testing without deployment setup, or to validate built Artifacts before deployment, use the `view` subcommand to launch a local web server and preview them.

1. Build the Artifact first using the `build` command (see above)
2. **View it:** On the terminal, run:
   * `npx run-claude-artifact view artifact-file-name.html` for single-file artifacts, or
   * `npx run-claude-artifact view artifact-directory-name` for multi-file artifacts
   > For multi-file artifacts, specify the directory, not the HTML file.
3. The tool launches a temporary web server to serve the Artifact, and opens it in your browser. Press `Ctrl+C` on the terminal to stop the server when you're done viewing it.

### If you want to create a full project for one or more Artifacts

Instead of just viewing or building an Artifact, you may create a full project for further development, and optionally push it to your own Git repository.

Built with modern web development essentials including **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Shadcn UI**, and **file-based routing**, this pre-configured setup lets you focus on development rather than configuration. As a standard **React** application, you have the freedom to extend it with any features you need, from backend services like **Supabase** to web frameworks such as **Express**, **Fastify** or **Hono**.

You can blend AI-generated Artifacts with your own custom code, incorporate code generated by other AI tools, such as **v0.dev**, or even build applications **without any Artifacts at all** and just start with a base project template to power your custom development.

You'll be able to deploy your app anywhere, whether locally for your own use, in a company intranet or in a public-facing production environment, at the webhosting or cloud provider of your choice.

See the [Installation](#installation) section below for detailed installation instructions and advanced options.

## Limitations

This project is meant for running Artifacts that are interactive web apps, usually made in React, and for which Claude writes Javascript or Typescript code.

**Mermaid diagrams, SVGs, and other document-type Artifacts are out of the project’s scope.**

Also, Claude's Artifacts run client-side only (i.e. in the browser). As such, they are limited in their capabilities.

If you need a full-stack application (with database, APIs, etc.), I'll be honest, this is not the best project for that, as it does not provide a backend.

Nevertheless, it does provide a good starting point. You can still add a server-side framework to create a **full-stack application**, or **use a cloud Backend service** like **Supabase** or **Firebase**.

## What's included?

These are the libraries and frameworks this project provides, identical* to those available on Claude's Artifacts environment:

1. **React 18** for building user interfaces.
2. **TypeScript** to support Artifacts written in type-safe Javascript.
3. **Vite** for fast development and building.
4. **Shadcn UI** for pre-built, customizable components.
5. **Tailwind CSS** for compact and expressive embedded styling.
6. **Recharts** for creating dynamic, customizable charts and data visualizations.
7. **Lucide React** for a comprehensive library of open-source icons designed for React applications.

> \* Note that the actual versions of the packages currently in use in the Artifacts environment may differ from the ones installed by this project, as Anthropic may update them from time to time.  
> If a component generated by Claude fails to run properly because of an outdated package, please let me know.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
  minimum supported version is 20 (lts/iron), tested up to version 23.2, version 22.11 is recommended

1. **Clone & Setup** → Clone template, remove .git/npx, copy your artifact
2. **Run/Preview** → Start dev server (or build + preview if `--build` used), open in browser, block until Ctrl+C
3. **Cleanup** → Remove temporary directory

#### `build` Subcommand
1. **Clone & Setup** → Clone template, remove .git/npx, copy your artifact
2. **Build** → Build project (with `--expanded` affecting build type) - abort on failure
3. **Deploy** → Copy built files to output directory
4. **Cleanup** → Remove temporary directory

#### `view` Subcommand
1. **Start Server** → Launch web server to serve the specified HTML file
2. **Block** → Run until Ctrl+C

#### `create` Subcommand
1. **Clone & Setup** → Clone template, remove .git/npx, copy your artifact
2. **Create Project** → Move full project to target directory
3. **Git Setup** → Initialize repository, add remote, commit, push if requested
4. **Cleanup** → Remove temporary directory

### Subcommand Flow Matrix

| Subcommand | Input | Output | Server | Blocks? | Purpose |
|------------|-------|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| `run` (default) | `.tsx`/`.jsx` | ❌ | ✅ Dev/Preview | ✅ | Interactive testing |
| `build` | `.tsx`/`.jsx` | ✅ Files | ❌ | ❌ | Generate deployment files |
| `view` | `.html` | ❌ | ✅ Static | ✅ | Serve built files |
| `create` | `.tsx`/`.jsx` | ✅ Project | ❌ | ❌ | Development workspace |

### Deployment Directory Logic (for `build` subcommand)

| Build Type | --deploy-dir | Default Path | Output |
|------------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Single file | ❌ | Current Working Directory | `CWD/my-app.html` |
| Single file | ✅ | `/path/to/deploy` | `/path/to/deploy/my-app.html` |
| Multi-file | ❌ | CWD + filename | `CWD/my-app/index.html` + `CWD/my-app/assets/` |
| Multi-file | ✅ | `/path/to/deploy` | `/path/to/deploy/index.html` + `/path/to/deploy/assets/` |

### Notes
- **Git is always required** (for initially cloning the template)
- The release build embeds the favicon as a data URL

## Alternative Methods of Installation

### Using GitHub CLI
```bash
gh repo create my-project-name --template claudio-silva/claude-artifact-runner --private --clone
cd my-project-name
# Replace the demo artifact with your own
cp path/to/your-artifact.tsx src/artifacts/index.tsx
npm run dev
```

### Create from a GitHub Template

**Best for:** Creating a GitHub repository for your project without using the `npx` command.

1. Go to [github.com/claudio-silva/claude-artifact-runner](https://github.com/claudio-silva/claude-artifact-runner)
2. Click the green "Use this template" button
3. Choose "Create a new repository"
4. Name your repository and choose visibility settings
5. Clone your new repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Fork and Clone (Not Recommended)

**Note:** Forking is generally not recommended unless you plan to contribute back to the original project, as it maintains a connection to the upstream repository.

If you do fork:
1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork
3. Consider unlinking from upstream if you don't plan to contribute back:
   ```bash
   git remote remove upstream  # Remove connection to original repo
   ```


## After installation

The default app is composed of two demo components: a **login form** and a **signup form**. You can navigate between them by clicking on the link at the bottom of the form.

> These demo pages/components are just for demonstration purposes and can be easily replaced with your own components, either generated by Claude or created by yourself.  
> **This will NOT be the UI of your application.**

## Installing a single Artifact

If you have created a project and you want to install or update an Artifact on it, you can follow these simple steps:

1. Make sure the development server is running. If not, start it by running `npm run dev`.
2. Leave the browser open at the initial page and leave the development server running.
3. Delete the files in the `src/artifacts/` directory.
4. Download your Artifact from Claude.ai
5. Move the file to the `src/artifacts/` directory and rename it to `index.tsx`.
6. You'll immediately see your Artifact running on the open browser tab.

You'll be viewing the app in **development** mode. To generate the final app, ready for production, you'll need to build it first:
* Use `npm run build` to generate the release files.
* Or use `npm run build:single` to generate a single file containing the entire application.
* You'll find the built files in the `dist/` directory.

## Creating a multi-page application

If you want to create a multi-page application, you can follow these steps:

1. Follow the previous section's steps.
2. Generate more Artifacts using Claude and download them to the `src/artifacts/` directory.
5. Give each file it a unique name, such as `your-component.tsx`. Each component you add will be a new page accessible at `http://localhost:5173/your-component-name` (without the `.tsx` extension).
6. If you have `npm run dev` running in the background, the new pages will be ready to display immediately. If a page is already open when being updated, it will refresh automatically.
7. You can link Artifacts to each other to build a multi-page application.
   > **It's easy:** on each Artifact page, just add links that navigate to the other Artifacts, by specifying their names without the `.tsx` extension.  
   E.g. `<a href="my-component">Go to My Component</a>`
8. You can also use the `useNavigate` hook to navigate to a specific page.
9. Finally, to create a release build and publish your finished application, follow the instructions further below.

## Developing a more complex application

If you intend to create a more advanced application, you'll probably want to customize its visual appearance by changing styles, adding images and new components, creating a base layout with a top header and a sidebar with the main navigation menu, etc.

This section is intended for advanced users only, and is not required for simple applications.

### Customization

- For styling:
  - Prefer using Tailwind classes directly in components.
  - Use `src/index.css` only for Tailwind configuration and critical global styles.
  - For component-specific styles, use CSS Modules (*.module.css).
  - For complex styling needs (such as dynamic styles), consider styled-components or other CSS-in-JS solutions.
  - Modify `tailwind.config.mjs` to customize the Tailwind CSS theme.
- Place static assets (such as images) in the `public` folder.
- Update `main.tsx` to change the overall layout of the app (e.g. adding a navigation bar).
- Add or modify components in the `src/components/` directory.
  > **Note:** Shadcn UI components installed via `npx` are automatically placed in `src/components/ui`. All components come pre-installed by default, but if you remove some and later want to reinstall any, you may simply run `npx shadcn-ui@latest add <your-component>`.

### Removing unneeded components / libraries

The **Recharts** library and ALL **Shadcn UI** components come pre-installed, so that all code that Claude may generate will run *out-of-the-box*.

If you just want to run the Artifact locally, you may leave things as they are, but if you want to deploy the application or use it as a base for a larger project, you may want to optimize the application's bundle size.

To do that, you may remove the pre-installed components or libraries that are not required by your application.

#### Unneeded Shadcn UI components:
  Just delete the component's files from `src/components/ui`.

#### Unneeded packages (ex: Recharts):
  Use `npm remove` to uninstall them.

## Building for production

To create a production build, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized files in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

## Deploying your application

After running `npm run build`, you'll have a `dist` folder containing the built files (typically an HTML file, a JavaScript file, and a CSS file).

Here are several ways to deploy these files:

### Local test deployment

For local testing of the production build, you can also use the `serve` npx package:

1. Navigate to your project directory and run:
   ```
   npx serve -s dist
   ```

2. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the URL provided in the terminal).

### Traditional web hosting

If you want to deploy to a shared or dedicated web server:

1. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your web server's public HTML directory (often called `public_html`, `www`, or `htdocs`).

Remember to update any necessary configuration files (like `vite.config.ts`) before building your app if it is not being served from the root of your domain.

For example, for `vite.config.ts`, you may configure it like this:
```javascript
export default {
  base: '/subdirectory/', // Set this to the path your app is served from
  // other configurations
};
```

### Cloud hosting platforms

Here are some popular free cloud hosting platforms and how to deploy your app to them:

> Remember to run `npm run build` before deploying to ensure you're uploading the latest version of your app.

#### Netlify

1. Install the Netlify CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. Run the following command in your project directory:
   ```
   netlify deploy
   ```

3. Follow the prompts. When asked for the publish directory, enter `dist`.

4. For production deployment, use:
   ```
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

#### Vercel

1. Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Run the following command in your project directory:
   ```
   vercel
   ```

3. Follow the prompts. Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Vite project and use the correct settings.

#### GitHub Pages

1. If you haven't already, create a GitHub repository for your project.

2. Install the `gh-pages` package:
   ```
   npm install gh-pages --save-dev
   ```

3. Add these scripts to your `package.json`:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
   }
   ```

4. Run:
   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```

5. Set up GitHub Pages in your repository settings to use the `gh-pages` branch.

#### Cloudflare Pages

You can deploy to Cloudflare Pages either through the Cloudflare dashboard or using the `wrangler` CLI tool. Here's how to do it using `wrangler`, which is often the most straightforward method:

1. **Install Wrangler:**
   ```
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

2. **Login to Cloudflare:**
   ```
   wrangler login
   ```

3. **Deploy your project:**
   ```
   wrangler pages deploy dist
   ```

   This command will prompt you to create a new project if one doesn't exist, and then deploy your `dist` folder to Cloudflare Pages.

4. **Configure your project (optional):**
   If you need more control over your deployment, you can create a `wrangler.toml` file in your project root:

   ```toml
   name = "my-react-app"
   compatibility_date = "2024-07-16" # Replace with the current date

   [site]
   bucket = "./dist"
   ```

   Note: The `account_id` and `workers_dev` fields are typically not needed for Cloudflare Pages deployments.

5. **Custom domain and production settings:**
   To use a custom domain or configure production settings, you can use the Cloudflare Pages dashboard. There, you can set up your domain, configure environment variables, and manage other deployment settings.

## Available npm Scripts

When working with the project directly (not using the npx command), you can use these npm scripts:

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server |
| `npm run build` | Build multi-file artifact (separate JS/CSS files) |
| `npm run build:single` | Build single-file artifact (inlined assets) |
| `npm run build:strict` | Build multi-file with TypeScript strict checking |
| `npm run build:single:strict` | Build single-file with TypeScript strict checking |
| `npm run preview` | Preview built artifacts locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |

### Build Types

- **Multi-file builds** (`build`, `build:strict`): Create separate HTML, JS, and CSS files in the `dist/` directory
- **Single-file builds** (`build:single`, `build:single:strict`): Create a single self-contained HTML file with all assets inlined
- **Strict builds** (`build:strict`, `build:single:strict`): Include TypeScript type checking before building
- **Regular builds** (`build`, `build:single`): Skip TypeScript checking for faster builds

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, try the following:

1. Clear your browser cache and restart the development server.
2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and run `npm install` again.
3. Make sure your Node.js version is compatible with the project requirements.
4. Check for any error messages in the console and search for solutions online.
